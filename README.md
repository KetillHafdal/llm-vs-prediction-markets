# LLMs vs Prediction Markets

This repository contains the data collection and analysis code used in the Master's thesis:

> *To what extent are large language models able to replicate or complement human forecasting in decentralised prediction markets?*

The thesis evaluates the probabilistic forecasting performance of large language models (LLMs) relative to market-implied probabilities from Polymarket, using proper scoring rules and market-level statistical comparisons.
